# Live-Fitness

Live Fitness is a fictional workout studio based company that has different workout locations for their members to choose from. Each studio has multiple classes a day, with multiple members and 1 instructor per class.
The database system is for internal use and as such the users would be anywhere from 5-10 (access would be for the studio's managers).
